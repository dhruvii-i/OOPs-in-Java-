# OOPs in Java

# Assignment-1:
1. Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,
Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console).

BufferedReader is a package in java.io used to efficiently read a text from character input stream. It uses buffer to read data in chunks by minimizing the number of operations and hence improving the performance.

DataOutputStream is a package used when a binary data file is to be written that contains primitive data types.

DataInputStreamer is used to read or interpret the binary data file.




2. Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, multiplication, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (Mean calculation: program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)
