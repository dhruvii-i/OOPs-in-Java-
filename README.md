# OOPs in Java

# Assignment-1:
1. Implement a menu-driven Java program (like fib or factorial) to implement these input methods in java (command line args,
Scanner, BufferedReader, DataInputStream, Console).

BufferedReader is a package in java.io used to efficiently read a text from character input stream. It uses buffer to read data in chunks by minimizing the number of operations and hence improving the performance.

DataOutputStream is a package used when a binary data file is to be written that contains primitive data types.

DataInputStreamer is used to read or interpret the binary data file.




2. Implement a simple menu driven calculator in java to implement add, sub, multiplication, div, sqrt, power, mean, variance. Implement a separate Calculator class to include all related function inside that class. (Mean calculation: program reads numbers from the keyboard, summing them in the process until the user enters the string "end". It then stops input & displays the avg. of numbers)

# Assignment-2:

Part 1: Write
a Java program that declares two arrays named 'even' and 'odd'.
Accept numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending
on whether they are even or odd.

This Java program defines a class NearestNeighbors that contains a method findNearestNeighborsIndex which takes an array of integers as input and returns the index of the first number of the nearest neighbors in the array, along with printing the distance between those neighbors. The main method of the class prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the array and the elements themselves. Then, it calls the findNearestNeighborsIndex method and prints the index of the nearest neighbors.

Part 2: Implement a Java method  that
finds two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to
each. The function should return the index of the 1st number.

This Java program demonstrates the conversion between an array and an ArrayList. It first converts an array of integers to an ArrayList using Arrays.asList(array) method. Then, it prints out the ArrayList. Next, it creates an ArrayList of strings and adds some elements to it. It converts this ArrayList back to an array using toArray() method and prints out the elements of the array.

Part 3: Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and
vice versa.

This Java program declares two arrays named 'even' and 'odd'. It prompts the user to enter the number of elements, then accepts numbers from the user and moves them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd. Finally, it prints out the contents of the 'even' and 'odd' arrays.
